# Welcome to Botanify!

## To run locally

From your terminal:

```sh
git clone <url>
cd to repo
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Things I considered:

- Accessibility
  - This app is pretty image heavy, so I mainly focused on ensuring all images had alt attributes.
  - I used [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse) to periodically audit my pages.

## Todo:

- Unit tests

Server will be available at http://localhost:3000/
